![Arlinde Vrooman](PortraitArlinde.jpg){: style="float: left; margin-right: 1em;"}Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at Tilburg School of Economics and Management, where I work on a research project into the future of Dutch economics academic education. I also supervise bachelor theses on quantitative economics topics and teach several courses at University College Tilburg.


Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Tilburg Center of the Learning Sciences of Tilburg University, where I worked on the same educational research project, supervised bachelor theses and taught Institutional Economics at University College Tilburg (Dec 2023 - Jul 2024). 

From 2018 to 2024, I was affiliated with the University of Groningen, within the Department of Economics, Econometrics and Finance, where I obtained my PhD in Economics in March 2024. My [PhD thesis](https://doi.org/10.33612/diss.902625484) researches the effect of colonial rule on disease and health care in Ghana and Côte d'Ivoire (ca. 1900-1955).


My research interests include (African) economic history, economics of education, development economics and international economics.
