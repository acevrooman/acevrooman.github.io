![Arlinde Vrooman](PortraitArlinde.jpg){: style="float: left; margin-right: 1em;"}Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Tilburg Center of the Learning Sciences of Tilburg University, where I work on an educational research project. I also supervise bachelor theses on quantitative economics topics and teach Institutional Economics at University College Tilburg.


Previously, I was affiliated with the University of Groningen, within the Department of Economics, Econometrics and Finance, where I obtained my PhD in Economics in March 2024. My PhD thesis researches the effect of colonial rule on disease and health care in Ghana and Côte d'Ivoire (ca. 1900-1955).


My research interests include (African) economic history, international economics, development economics, and economics of education.
