Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Tilburg Center of the Learning Sciences] (https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/nl/onderzoek/instituten-en-researchgroepen/center-learning-sciences) of Tilburg University. Previously, I was affiliated with the University of Groningen, where I obtained my PhD in economics in March 2024.
I also supervise bachelor theses on quantitative economics topics and teach lectures in Institutional Economics at University college Tilburg.
