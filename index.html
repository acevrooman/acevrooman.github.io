Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Tilburg Center of the Learning Sciences of Tilburg University, where I work on an educational research project. I also supervise bachelor theses on quantitative economics topics and teach lectures in Institutional Economics at University college Tilburg.

Previously, I was affiliated with the University of Groningen, within the Department of Economics, Econometrics and Finance, where I obtained my PhD in Economics in March 2024. My PhD thesis researches the effect of colonial rule on health and health care in Ghana and CÃ´te d'Ivoire during the twentieth century.

My research interests include economic history, with a specific focus on African Economic history, development economics, and economics of education.
